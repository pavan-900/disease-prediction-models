# 🧠 Anxiety Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project presents machine learning models for predicting **anxiety risk levels** based on clinical, behavioral, and demographic data. It aims to support early detection and mental health intervention through AI-driven analytics.

Mental health conditions like **anxiety disorders** often go underdiagnosed due to subjective symptoms and social stigma. Predictive modeling can assist healthcare providers by offering **objective risk scores**, helping initiate early therapy or clinical evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- To develop machine learning models that classify individuals based on their likelihood of experiencing anxiety.
- Use patient-level data such as sleep patterns, social behavior, medical history, and demographics.
- Provide interpretable predictions that could be embedded in **mHealth apps** or **mental health dashboards**.

---

## 🩺 Healthcare Relevance

- **Anxiety disorders** affect over 300 million people globally.
- Early risk detection through AI can reduce the burden on mental healthcare systems.
- This project promotes **AI-based screening** in non-clinical settings like schools, workplaces, or telehealth platforms.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Binary or Multiclass Classification** (e.g., low/moderate/high anxiety risk)
- 📊 Models trained and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, ROC-AUC, and F1-score
- 🧠 ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost
- 📈 Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Feature Importance
